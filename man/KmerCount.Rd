\title{K-mer counting}
\usage{
KmerCount(sequences, K = 1, col.names = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{Vector of sequences (text).}

\item{K}{Word length (integer).}

\item{col.names}{Logical indicating if the words should be added as columns names.}
}
\value{
A matrix with one row for each sequence in \code{sequences} and one column for 
each possible word of length\code{K}.
}
\description{
Counting overlapping words of length K in DNA/RNA sequences.
}
\details{
For each input sequence, the frequency of every word of length \code{K} is counted. 
Counting is done with overlap. The counting itself is done by a C++ function.

With \code{col.names = TRUE} the K-mers are added as column names, but this makes the
computations slower.
